# IPL-Match-Pred-CSK-VS-RCB-

Here's a basic AI/ML model for IPL Cricket Match Prediction using Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. It takes 10 sample players from CSK and RCB, processes the data, and predicts the winner using Logistic Regression.

 Key Features:
Uses basic AI/ML concepts (logistic regression).
Uses NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (as per your requirement).
No complex libraries (like TensorFlow or Scikit-learn).

âœ… How This Works
Takes 10 players from CSK and RCB.
Uses batting, bowling averages, strike rate, and wickets as input features.
Normalizes the data to prevent overflow errors.
Trains a logistic regression model to predict the winner.
Outputs predictions & visualizes results using Matplotlib.

ðŸŽ¯ Why This Model?
âœ… Beginner-Friendly (No ML libraries like sklearn/tensorflow).
âœ… AI Model for IPL Prediction 
âœ… Uses Only Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
